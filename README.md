# Diesel-Petrol-Pump-Price-Analysis

Pump prices of Diesel and Petrol have seen lot of ups and downs in last 17 years. 
Prices of Diesel and Petrol are decided by the crude oil prices in the world oil market. In UK, usually the prices of Diesel are higher than Petrol and this difference becomes bigger in winter months due to higher Diesel consumption. There were few rare occasions in last 17 years when Diesel prices were slightly cheaper than petrol. We have used the data from Makeovermonday website provided by the UKâ€™s Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy to come up with an interactive dashboard, which gives us a lot of flexibility to slice and dice the weekly pump prices data and get meaningful insights.
